NodeView TODO list
==================

+ support GWA files.

+ when no -warp is specified, choose first map in wad.

+ allow decent into a subsector (solid purple polygon ?).

- info line at bottom of main window:
	- map name.
	- mouse coords.
	- zoom factor.
    - current node/subsector.

- class-ify the wad structures.  [partially done]

- partition line: draw arrow heads along it.
