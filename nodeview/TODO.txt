NodeView TODO list
==================

+ support GWA files.

- info line at bottom of main window:
	- map name.
	- mouse coords.
	- zoom factor.
    - current node/subsector.

- partition line: draw arrow heads along it.

DONE: allow decent into a subsector (solid purple polygon).
DONE: when no -warp is specified, choose first map in wad.
DONE: class-ify the wad structures.
