TODO
====

TEST: blockmap: if overflows, don't write anything.
TEST: V5 structures.
TEST: write ZDoom format normal nodes.

+  GL_LEVEL support (remove 5-letter level-name limit).

-  store info in GL header lumps.

-  detect "see through one-siders" and add miniseg there. (MAP07 10sec2)

   >> Algorithm: 1) detect anomalous lines in MinisegIntersect pass.
                 2) double check line by casting a ray on "void" side.

-  don't merge vertices.


LATER / IDEAS
=============

-  reinstate "normal-only" node build.

-  create empty REJECT rather than "minimal" (save space) ?

+  simplify callback interface.

-  MacOS X: Project builder setup for glBSPX.

-  Autoconf / Automake.
