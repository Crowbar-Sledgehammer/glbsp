====

Test:  UtilTimeString() under WIN32.

+  don't merge vertices.

-  documentation stuff ??


LATER / IDEAS
=============

+  detect "see through one-siders" and add miniseg there. (MAP07 10sec2)

   >> Algorithm: 1) detect anomalous lines in MinisegIntersect pass.
                 2) double check line by casting a ray on "void" side.

-  simplify callback interface.
-  reinstate "normal-only" node build.
-  create empty REJECT rather than "minimal" (save space) ?
-  Autoconf / Automake.
-  MacOS X: Project builder setup for glBSPX.
